To run:

make sure you are in project1 directory.
cmd to run: matlab -batch "main"


Project structure:
	main and output/readme txt files are in projects\,
	operations directory contains the code for each and every lab/requested operation.
		each operation i.e lagrange , will have the matlab file and some preset txt files for file input.
			user can choose to use preset file or input a string that can be a path to other file or a formatted string.
				




Resources I used:

MATLAB Documentation - to learn about various functions I could call for file read/write, and GUI.

ChatGPT 4.0 - if I needed extra explanation about the use of a function I would ask for help understanding it. For example: I knew that I could use evalc() to take the terminal output and transfer to a variable, however the MATLAB documentation wasn't clear for when the file was in a different directory.
